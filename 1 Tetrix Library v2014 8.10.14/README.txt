1. This is a compendium of all Tetrix parts for the 2013-2014 FTC challenge as well as Lego NXT Educational kit parts.

2. Everything is in SolidWorks 2014 format, which means they must be opened with SolidWorks 2014 or later.

3. Images of each part are provided in PNG format for your convenience.

4. All parts were converted from PTC's CAD files at <http://www.catalogds.com/db/service?d=first&c=browse>. I gave the Tetrix parts colors and materials, but most of the Lego parts remain plain gray. Also, I can give no guarantees as to part accuracy.
