#Welcome
This is the complete collection of CAD documents for FTC team 4290, High Phidelity, for the 2014-2015 challenge "Cascade Effect." All the documents in the `src` directory are created by and for SolidWorks 2014 only. The `stl` directory contains .STL files for each part of the robot. The STL for the whole robot is named `4290.STL` and be found [here](https://github.com/lasarobotics/GiraPHPHe/blob/master/4290.STL)

We've really enjoyed building this robot for the Cascade Effect season. If you have any feedback/compliments/questions, we can be reached on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/lasa_ftc4290).
