# Giraphphe
LASA Robotics 2014-2015 FTC Team 4290 presents... the Open Source robot GiraPHPHe!
#TO BE UPDATED BEFORE RELEASE:
This is the complete collection of CAD documents for FTC team 4290, HiPhi, for the 2014-2015 challenge "Cascade Effect." All these documents are created by and for SolidWorks 2014 only. They cannot be read by any previous version of SolidWorks.

I've arranged everything in folders to make things easy to find (I hope). The folders are numbered so that file explorers will display them in a logical order. Please try to name parts logically so it's easy for multiple people can work on this.

"4290.SLDASM" is the complete robot assembly. Everything else should be in a subdirectory.
